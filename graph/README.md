# 1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
  DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all possible paths. It starts at a node and goes as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It can be implemented using recursion or a stack.

  Time Complexity 
    Best Case: O(V+E)
  
  Space Complexity: O(V + E)
